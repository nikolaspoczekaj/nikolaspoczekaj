### ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Niko! ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± I'm a 23-year-old Computer Science student from Wedel, near Hamburg, Germany.

ğŸ”­ Currently, I'm working as a student developer for a medium-sized company in Wedel, where I mainly do C# and database development.

ğŸ‘¯ I'm looking forward to contributing to the open source community, because I really like the idea of collaborating and learning with people from all over the world.
